 Buttermilk gives this cake its 
 wonderfully moist and tender crumb.
 You can make a good substitute for commercial
  buttermilk by adding 1 tablespoon of white distilled vinegar, cider vinegar,
   or lemon juice to 1 cup (240 ml) of milk and letting this mixture sit at room
    temperature about 10 minutes before using.
     What makes it different 
is that besides cream cheese, it also contains mascarpone cheese and whipped 
cream. This makes the frosting deliciously rich and creamy. Now, Mascarpone 
cheese is an Italian cheese that is thick, buttery-rich, delicately sweet and 
velvety. It is often sold in plastic 8-ounce (227 grams) tubs. You may find it 
in specialty food stores or in the deli section of your local grocery store. If
 you cannot find Mascarpone just substitute with 8 ounces (227 grams) of cream 
 cheese.
