If you look beyond the striking appearance of a Red Velvet Cake, you will find
 that it has a very mild chocolate flavor of unsweetened cocoa powder.
 nce the Red Velvet Cake has been baked and cooled, I like to chill the layers 
in the refrigerator until firm before filling and frosting the cake. This extra 
step makes the spreading of the frosting a much easier task, as a freshly baked 
cake is quite fragile and when you try to spread the frosting there is a 
tendency for the cake to tear. Refrigerating the cake first eliminates this
 problem. 
 I love to frost a Red Velvet Cake with a Cream Cheese Frosting. But the Cream 
Cheese Frosting I use is a little different than most.
